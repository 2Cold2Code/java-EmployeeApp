This guided project is in two parts. First we do the standard hello world application and then a more complex application.

The Hello World Application
Note that this is a two class hello world program. Explain what a hello world application is

make directory
<work dir>/helloworld/src/hello

Under that directory
Create the HelloWorld.java code
Explain the new Greeter call

Create the Greeter.java code

Compile code from the src directory
javac hello/*.java

Create the jar archive file
jar cvfe helloworld.jar hello.HelloWorld hello/*.class
     c - create a new archive file with given name
     v - generate verbose output
     f - specifies the jar output file to be created
     e - sets the main class also called the entry point

execute the file
java -jar helloworld.jar



*** Second project

Create directory
<work dir>/EmployeeAPP/src/employeeApp

Create employee.java

Create company.java

Create Healthplan.java

Create Main.java
Give data

Complile showing how h1 does not appear

Do practice rounds 1 - 4 in order
enter the code for the practice round and then execute the code by doing the following

from the src directory

javac employeeApp/*.java

jar cvfe EmpApp.jar employeeApp.Main employeeApp/*.class
     c – create new archive file with given name
     v – generate verbose output
     f – specifies the jar output file to be created
     e – sets the main class also called the entry point

java -jar EmpApp.jar
